### A simple weather app built with React and Typescript

It's a pretty simple app, but I had some fun adding weather effects.

**If you're forking/building this, you'll need an API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/current), which you will need to add to a .env file with the variable name VITE_OWAPI_KEY**
